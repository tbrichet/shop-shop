# Redux Store
Lesson 22 Weekly Challenge | State Challenge

## Student Name

## Creation Date

## Purpose
This project required students to update an existing e-commerge platform to use Redux to manage global state instead of the Context API so that the website's state management would be taken out of the React ecosystem.

## Project Requirements
* GIVEN an e-commerce platform that uses Redux to manage global state <br>
* WHEN I review the appâ€™s store <br>
* THEN I find that the app uses a Redux store instead of the Context API <br>
* WHEN I review the way the React front end accesses the store <br>
* THEN I find that the app uses a Redux provider <br>
* WHEN I review the way the app determines changes to its global state <br>
* THEN I find that the app passes reducers to a Redux store instead of using the Context API <br>
* WHEN I review the way the app extracts state data from the store <br>
* THEN I find that the app uses Redux instead of the Context API <br>
* WHEN I review the way the app dispatches actions <br>
* THEN I find that the app uses Redux instead of the Context API <br>
